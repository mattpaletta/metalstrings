# metalstrings

This repository contains experiments I was doing including implementing C strings in Metal.

I also was playing around with the `prefixSum` algorithm.  I also borrowed an implementation from: https://kieber-emmons.medium.com/efficient-parallel-prefix-sum-in-metal-for-apple-m1-9e60b974d62 and do not claim ownership of this metal code.
